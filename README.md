# Dovecot Graveyard

Repository for unsupported features removed from Dovecot

## What is this?

This is a repository where we put code we remove from Dovecot that we no longer want to maintain.
If you want to start maintaining the code, please copy it to a new repository (or fork this repository).

## Can I contribute?

As a rule, no. This is a one-way repository, and if you want to update/maintain something you should fork your own.

## I need help with the code!

You can send mail to dovecot@dovecot.org, but this code is unsupported, so we will not promise anything.
